# 3D Finite Element Solver

This project is a 3D finite element solver implemented in C#. It allows for the analysis of structures composed of frame and shell members using finite element methods.

## Features

- **Frame Analysis**: Perform analysis of frame members using various finite element techniques, such as the stiffness method or direct stiffness approach.
- **Shell Analysis**: Conduct analysis of shell members using finite element methods, considering both linear and nonlinear behaviors.
- **Structural Analysis**: Perform comprehensive structural analysis of complex 3D structures, including deformation, stresses, and reactions.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the displacement profiles of the analyzed structure using the gnuplot.exe tool.
- **Post-processing**: Provide tools for post-processing of analysis results, including generation of detailed reports and graphical representations.

## Future Development

- adding nonlinear analysis options. 

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).

3. Build and run the project.

4. Customize the input files or parameters according to your specific structural model and analysis requirements.

5. Analyze the structure and review the results using the provided visualization and post-processing tools.

6. Example usage is shown in "TestConsol/Program.cs".
